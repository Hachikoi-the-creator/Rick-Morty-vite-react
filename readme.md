# [Live Deployment](https://rick-morty-vite-react.vercel.app/)

# todo:
- empty :DDD

# Done
- Found how to use variables (Global styles) so all colors and default border radius change it for variables
- add a loading state to card component, and fetch the extra info there, if after the info was fetched there still was no new change, show the missing info component
  - furthermore check more exaustively what info is missing and just add [REDACTED] instead
  - added a pretty cool animated svg!
  - instead of doing another API petition just did a single one and everything goes way better now :DDDD
- Actually do something whit the login page kek
- Make the details component more robust
  - Only show available data and double check every prop
  - Only when every prop fails, show the crashed ship img
- Do the contact page
  - create a little input component and render those inside a container 
- add animation to the close btn
- Added (In poggers) in empty pages
- add cute heart favicon

**Extra delay on card details is because I make another API call everytime I enter that component, to fetch extra info about that character**
